What is the estimated total value of the City of Waterloo's infrastructure?,Approximately $4 billion.,"['***8.3.2.1 What do we own and what is it worth?***\nThe City’s water distribution assets are 2,601 fire hydrants and the 442 km of watermains that transport\nclean water to our homes and businesses. This involves managing a reliable water system capable of providing\nsufficient quality, flow, and pressure to satisfy drinking, recreational, irrigation, fire protection, and business\nneeds. Treated drinking water is purchased from the Region of Waterloo and distributed to the community by\nthe City of Waterloo. The Region of Waterloo manages all water treatment plants and sells the treated water\nto the lower-tier municipalities within the Region, like the City.\n\nWater distribution is a highly regulated service, and the City of Waterloo must meet strict provincial\nregulations and drinking water quality standards. This requires an extensive network of infrastructure valued at\napproximately $635 million. It is important to note that the fleet and associated equipment (e.g. flusher truck)\nare captured under the fleet asset class.\n\nPlease see section 5.1 for an overview of the context and asset management regarding ownership and\nreplacement value.

Which regulation does the City of Waterloo's Asset Management Plan comply with?,Ontario Regulation 588/17 (O. Reg. 588/17).,"['This regulation requires every municipality to prepare a Strategic Asset Management Policy and an\nAsset Management Plan linked to their strategic objectives with the expectation that outputs of the\nasset management planning process inform financial long-term and budgetary planning processes.\nThis asset management plan will meet the regulatory requirements for the 2025 O. Reg. 588/17\nmilestones including recommendations on proposed levels of service and the funding required to\n\nmeet them.\n\nThe structure and sequence of the regulation’s requirements is highlighted below along with our\ncompliant documents.\n\nFigure 3: Structure and Sequence of O.Reg.588/17 Requirements\n\nCity of Cambridge | 13\n\n', '#### 1.4 Assets Not Included\n\nInformation technology assets are not covered in this AM Plan. Only facilities and fleet\nassets are included in this AM Plan for the following Service Areas. Although other\nprogram assets may be included in future plans, the facility and fleet assets comprise\nthe greatest value of assets within these areas:\n\n  Waterloo Region Housing\n\n  - Children’s Services\n\n  - Seniors’ Services\n\n - Paramedic Services\n\n  Waterloo Regional Police.\n\nWater Services manages the following assets which are owned by the Region but not\nincluded in this AM Plan:\n\n  Monitoring wells\n\n  - Test wells.\n#### 1.5 Legislated Requirements for Asset Management Plans\n\nThe challenges of public sector entities to maintain and renew ageing infrastructure\nunder current funding/resource levels and structures is widely recognized. Rapid\ngrowth, public demands for high levels of service, increased exposure to liability and\nrisk, and downloaded responsibilities add to these challenges. While the Region has a\nlong history of implementing advanced asset management practices that incorporate\nasset renewal, enhanced operation and maintenance practices, policies, and programs,\nthere has also been a legislative and regulatory push for the development of formal\nasset management plans which formalize these strategies.\n\nIn January 2018, the Province of Ontario enacted **Ontario Regulation 588/17** ‘Asset\nManagement Planning for Municipal Infrastructure’ under the Infrastructure for Jobs and\nProsperity Act, 2015. The regulation requires municipalities to develop an AM Plan\nbased on current Levels of Service by July 1st, 2021 for core assets (roads, and bridges\nand culverts, stormwater, water, wastewater) and July 1st, 2023 requirements for other\nmunicipal infrastructure assets. The Region’s core assets support delivery of\ntransportation and water services. By July 1st 2024, a more advanced AM Plan\n(Proposed Levels of Service) is required for all assets. Other legislative and regulatory\nrequirements for Asset Management Plans include the following:\n\n\n**Province of Ontario**\n\n**Infrastructure for**\n**Jobs and**\n**Prosperity Act**\n\n\nThe Infrastructure for Jobs & Prosperity Act (IJPA), 2015 was proclaimed on May\n1, 2016. The purpose of this Act is to establish mechanisms to encourage\nprincipled, evidence-based and strategic long-term infrastructure planning that\nsupports job creation and training opportunities, economic growth and protection of\nthe environment, and incorporate design excellence into infrastructure planning.\nThe Act sets out principles which the Province and all broader public sector entities\n(including Municipalities) should consider when making decisions respecting\ninfrastructure. The Act also stipulates that the Province and all broader public\nsector entities prepare infrastructure asset management plans.\n\n**Region of Waterloo** | AM Plan | Docs No. 3329097 | 5\n\n', '## Executive Summary\n\nThe City of Waterloo (City), like most cities, is responsible for providing a significant number of services,\nincluding infrastructure needs, and has limited financial resources to maintain them. The City owns\ninfrastructure that is valued at almost $4 billion and is comprised of a variety of complex asset groups. These\nassets support the City’s ability to provide a wide range of services to the community, such as sports field\nprogramming, the active transportation network, municipal enforcement, day camps, and swimming lessons.\nThese services are supported by a wide range of infrastructure assets enabling a quality of life enjoyed by\nstakeholders. An important aspect of offering services is the installation and treatment (i.e. maintenance,\nrehabilitation, and replacement) of the infrastructure that is required to provide these services. The City has\nsupported community growth by building the infrastructure needed to offer these services.\n\nDeveloping and sustaining public infrastructure is a complex and challenging task requiring continuous\nimprovement and monitoring. This Asset Management Plan (AMP) is the City of Waterloo’s (City) third\ncomprehensive AMP and will assist with data-driven decision-making for the City’s assets. The AMP includes\nthe consideration of installation, maintenance, rehabilitation, and replacement of the infrastructure that is the\nbackbone of the community. This document has been developed to meet Phase 1 through Phase 3 of **[Ontario](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/regulation/170588)**\n**[Regulation 588/17: Asset Management Planning for Municipal Infrastructure](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/regulation/170588)** (O. Reg. 588/17).\n\nThe City’s AMP has been developed using currently available data for asset inventory, performance, and\ndeterioration rates along with funding included in the 2023 Approved Capital Budget and 2024-2032 Capital\nForecast. All this information is captured within the City’s custom-built Waterloo Decision Support System\n(Waterloo DSS) and allows for illustration of how planned renewal expenditures affect the performance\nof the assets over the next 25 years.\n\nThe Waterloo DSS has forecasting capabilities that allow staff to project the performance of City assets\nover a 25-year timeframe. The analysis is completed using the current year asset inventory, performance, and\ndeterioration trends, and planned funding included in the 2023 Approved Capital Budget and 2024-2032 Capital\nForecast, as well as any unspent rehabilitation and replacement funding from in-process projects, approved\nin prior budget cycles. The analysis excludes proposed infrastructure funding incorporated in the staff-tabled\n2024-2026 budget for Council’s approval on February 12, 2024, or the financial impacts of reaching Council’s\nambitious new goal for the corporation to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. Using this “status quo” approach,\nit is estimated that over the next 25 years, the performance of City assets will decline. Specifically, it is projected\nthat the proportion of tax-base funded assets exhibiting a poor or very poor performance profile will increase\nfrom 34% to 76%. Enterprise-funded assets are also projected to decline over the 25-year timeframe, changing\nfrom 25% of assets with a poor or very poor performance profile to almost 50%.\n\nIn summary, the 2024 AMP is fully compliant with Phase 1 through Phase 3 of O. Reg. 588/17 and the\ninformation demonstrates that the City is continuing to manage its assets in a responsible manner.\n\n\n2\n\n', '**FIGURE 2: ONTARIO REGULATION 588/17 REQUIREMENT PHASE-IN REVISED TIMELINE**\n##### Strategic Asset Management Policy\n\nOne of the requirements of O. Reg. 588/17 is the requirement that all municipalities prepare Council-endorsed\nStrategic AM Policies by July 1, 2019, and shall review and, if necessary, update it at least every five years.\n\nThe City of Waterloo met that requirement through Council’s approval of CORP2019-006 Asset Management\nPolicy Update on March 18, 2019. While O. Reg 588/17 identifies a review requirement every 5 years, the\ncurrent plan is to review the policy one year in advance of an AMP update resulting in a 4-year AM policy\nreview cycle to match the 4-year AMP cycle.\n\nAM staff reviewed the Strategic AM policy and CORP2023-039 Strategic Asset Management Policy Update\nwas approved by Council on November 20, 2023. The policy updates included a best practice review of\nother municipalities as well as incorporating people-centered outcome considerations and updated internal\ngovernance components as recommended by the City’s Reconciliation, Equity, Accessibility, Diversity, and\nInclusion (READI) team.\n##### Phase 1 Requirements: Core Assets\n\nPhase 1 is specific to assets identified as ‘core assets’, comprised of roads, bridges, stormwater, water and\nsanitary. This phase was completed through Council’s approval of CAO2020-009 on November 2, 2020,\nand includes an inventory of core assets, current levels of service and the cost to maintain levels of services.

What is the forecasted decline in performance of tax-base funded assets over 25 years?,Projected increase of assets in poor or very poor condition from 34% to 76%.,"['State of the Assets\nCity of Guelph Corporate Asset Management Plan 2024\n\n\n**Tax Funded Services**\n\nThe methodology used to determine the target year to\nreach sustainability for the tax-funded services was\nthe same as that used for the rate-funded services\nincluding the reduction in the annual funding rate\nincrease once sustainability is reached.\n\nNotably, the 100% target is not predicted to be\nreached until around year 2056. Until that time,\ndespite years where the forecast funding is predicted\nto be greater than the forecast needs, the cumulative\neffect of previous years insufficient funding means that\nthe sustainability target will not be reached.\n\nFigure 19 presents the ratio of funding to needs and\npresents the actual renewal cost forecast and funding\nvalues. Note that to be able to represent the year\nwhen sustainability is reached these two figures both\nuse a 30-year forecast instead of the 25-year period in\nprevious charts.\n\nWith the current funding strategies being used the\nservices will be underfunded through the next 25years accumulating a negative funding gap that\nreaches a nadir around year 2039. This is a result of\nthe cumulative effect of the 2024 deferred work\nbacklog and the needs outweighing the funding until\naround 2048 when the funding is predicted to\ncontinuously be greater than the needs. After that\ntime the available funding is sufficient to begin closing\nthe gap and by 2056 it remains positive.\n\n\n**Figure 19: Tax-Funded Services: Percent of**\n**Renewal Funding. Note: 35-year time period**\n\nThe same caveats outlined for the rate funded services\napply to the tax funded services: if the collected tax\nrevenue is lower than the values predicted in this\nanalysis and/or if any extra IR funding per year is not\ncommitted to closing the deferred work backlog the\nsustainability target date will be extended further\nbeyond 2056.\n\nPage 59\n\n', 'State of the Assets\nCity of Guelph Corporate Asset Management Plan 2024\n\n**Figure 20: Tax-Funded Services 25-Year Annual Forecast Renewal vs. Forecast Funding.

Both scenarios use a similar approach for the first year of the projection by using the weighted average\nof replacement cost based on the current asset inventory, performance, replacement costs, and the approved\ninfrastructure funding. The remaining years are a projection based on the deterioration of the assets along with\nthe rehabilitation or replacement of assets based on the approved/forecasted infrastructure funding approved\nby Council.\n\nAn important component is the method of projecting performance is how the assets as assessed. Park asset\nperformance is evaluated using historical knowledge, age and observed conditions. The quality and availability\nof our asset data (data maturity) are continuously evolving. The current data maturity level for park assets is\nassessed to be low. The City is continuously working to improve asset data quality as outlined in section 3.1.\n\nSection 8.2.3.3 identifies the lifecycle management activities required to provide the levels of services offered\nby park assets and are funded through the capital and operating budgets. To maintain the current level of\nservice provided in 2023, the City needs to maintain the annual operating budget funding of $759,000 million\nconsidered to be directly related to treating park assets as identified in **Table 10** . In addition to the operating\nfunding, the City needs to continue to invest the $1.8 million annually and increase capital funding to close\nthe $2.4 million average funding gap as identified in **Table 12** . It is important to recognize that park assets\nhave a low data maturity rating and that as the data maturity improves, there will be greater confidence in the\nperformance projections as identified in section 3.1. As a result, the estimated total funding projected based\non the available data to provide the lifecycle activities to maintain the current level is $5 million each year.\n\nThe forecasted funding requirements to accommodate growth to maintain services are identified in **Table 11**\nand will be evaluated, refined, and considered for approval by Council through each budget process.\n\n**8.2.3.4.1 Current Performance and Projected impact of Budgeted Capital Expenditures**\n\nApproximately 54% of park assets are currently considered in poor or very poor performance categories.\nThe average annual budgeted capital expenditure of approximately $1.8 million is anticipated to result in a\ndecline in the performance of park assets over the next 25 years, which is anticipated to be unacceptable\nto most interested parties. The portion of the asset class with fair, good, and excellent performance profiles\nstarts at 46% in 2023 and declines to less than 30% by 2047 as shown in **Figure 29** . Based on the best available\nasset data, deterioration rates and 2023-2032 capital funding, we estimate that park assets have an annual\ninfrastructure funding gap of $2.4 million.\n\n\n135\n\n', 'The annual infrastructure funding gap is calculated through the comparison of the Waterloo DSS budget and\ntarget scenario outputs. The budget scenario provides perspective on the projected performance of assets\nbased on the budgeted expenditures for each asset group. The target scenario generates the infrastructure\nexpenditure needed to achieve the target levels of service as established through collaboration with SMEs. The\nWaterloo DSS analysis uses the capital funding included in the 2023 Approved Capital Budget and 2024-2032\nCapital Forecast, as well as any unspent rehabilitation and replacement funding from in-progress projects\napproved in prior budget cycles for the first ten years. The analysis then uses the City’s 10-year average capital\nfunding for years 15-25 to calculate the projected performance.\n##### 3�.5�.1 Budget Scenario\n\n**Figure 4** illustrates the current projected tax-base asset performance over 25 years and identifies that 34%\nof the City’s tax-funded infrastructure assets currently exhibit poor or very poor performance profiles.\nHowever, more importantly, it is estimated that with current levels of funding, in 25 years, the proportion of\nassets exhibiting poor or very poor performance profiles will increase from 34% to approximately 76%. It is\nanticipated that this performance level will be unacceptable to most interested and affected parties.\n\n**FIGURE 4: PROJECTED ANNUAL PERFORMANCE OF TAX BASE ASSETS IN THE BUDGET SCENARIO**\n\nUsing the same approach for enterprise-funded infrastructure assets, **Figure 5** illustrates the projected\nperformance using currently available data. Similar to **Figure 4**, this graph represents enterprise asset inventory,\nperformance, and deterioration trends, and planned funding included in the 2023 Approved Capital BudgetAs described within the text the figure illustrates the current projected tax-base asset performance over 25 years.\n\n\n46\n\n', 'State of the Assets\nCity of Guelph Corporate Asset Management Plan 2024\n\n\n**Figure 12: Rate Funded Assets - Condition by**\n**Replacement Value**\n\n**Tax-Funded Assets**\n\nThe tax-funded assets and services include all the\ntransportation assets plus the non-core assets (except\nparking). Because the roads, bridges and all related\nassets comprise avout 30% of the City’s overall\ninventory the condition of those assets skews the\nresults of the tax-funded asset condition review\ngreatly with those needs. Likewise, a majority of the\ntax-funding available for renewal work is directed\ntowards transportation assets. Road right-of-way\nconstruction projects which also include renewals of\nwater, wastewater and stormwater assets normally\ncomprise the majority of the capital projects\ncompleted each year by the City.\n\n\nMost of the tax-funded assets – 67% - are in “fair” or\nbetter condition. This is very good, however, there\nremains about $628M or 19% of the assets identified\nin “past due” or “very poor” condition.\n\nThere are five (5) reserve funds that can be used to\nfund the renewal needs of the assets in this category:\n\n  - Infrastructure Renewal Fund\n\n  Canada Community Building Fund\n\n  - Dedicated Gas Tax Fund\n\n  Guelph Public Library Fund\n\n  Guelph Police Services Fund\n\nContributions to these funds is predominantly from the\ncollection of property taxes. The Canada Community\nBuilding Fund and Dedicated Gas Tax Fund receive\ncontributions from Provincial or Federal Government\n\ngrants.\n\nIn 2017, the City implemented a strategy to begin to\nclose the gap between the funding available and the\nfunding required for infrastructure renewal as\nidentified in the Asset Management Plan.

What is the primary funding source mentioned for infrastructure renewal?,Capital Infrastructure Reinvestment Reserve Fund (CIRRF).,"['### 4�.1 Current Funding Sources\n\nThe LTFP uses traditional sources of funding such as property tax, user fees, reserves, and debt as well as\ncommitted grant funding from the Canada Community Building Reserve Fund (CCBF) (formerly known as the\nFederal Gas Tax Fund) formula-based funding.

As the County gains a better\n\nunderstanding of the infrastructure investment needs and the available funding, the County will need to make\n\nimportant decisions regarding investment priorities, risk management, and climate change mitigation. The County will\n\nalso need to evaluate the ways in which it analyzes the benefits of its investments, the long-term operating budget\n\nimplications of its capital projects, and how it measures the performance of its assets against investments. All of these\n\ndecisions and processes will be informed by these nine principles and the County’s *Strategic Action Plan* .\n\nThe County’s *Annual Budget and Ten Year Plan* is supported by\n\nseveral sources of revenue. These sources are described below.\n\nThe County funds infrastructure renewal activities through a\n\ncombination of the following:\n\n  - Capital Reserves\n\n  - Infrastructure Funding (Grants and Subsidies) from\n\nUpper Levels of Government:\n\n`o` Canada Community Building Fund (CCBF),\n\nformerly Federal Gas Tax\n\n`o` Ontario Community Infrastructure Fund (OCIF)\n\n  - Recoveries from other Municipalities\n\n\n\n  - Development Charges\n\n  - Debt\n\n**Capital Reserves**\n\n\n**Figure 1.5-1** Nine principles of the *Long-Term*\n\n*Financial Sustainability Strategy* .\n\n\nThe County funds its capital budget predominately through capital reserves providing stable, predictable, and long-term\n\nsustainable funding. Capital reserves fund specific replacement or renewal of capital assets. Budgeted operating\n\ntransfers to reserves helps to smooth the impact on the tax levy. The *Reserves and Reserve Funds Policy* provides\n\nguidance on funding sources, use, and funding targets for these reserves. This is in alignment with the *Long-Term*\n\n*Financial Sustainability Strategy* and its principles of predictable infrastructure investment, long-term financial health,\n\nand strategic use of reserves.\n\n\nAsset Management Plan 2024  |  1 – Introduction\n\n\n20\n\n', 'Most local governments have limited options to raise additional funds for infrastructure, relying\nprimarily on tax levies, debt, and user fees. Rural and small municipalities are less attractive for\npublic-private partnerships (P3s) that can leverage private sector funds to deliver major projects.\nThis makes senior government support critical, whether through matching formulas for major\ncapital projects or grants and subsidies that can create additional capital for municipalities.\n\nGiven the level of investment required, it will take many years or decades for municipalities to\nreach fiscal sustainability. This section analyzes the Township of Wilmot’s current fiscal\nframework for supporting its infrastructure portfolio. It includes a financial strategy to close\nidentified annual funding gaps associated with capital spending, including maintenance,\nrehabilitation, and replacements.\n\n27\n\n', 'Included in the financing plan above is approximately $100 million in ICIP funding for\nGRT bus replacements, $50 million in funding from the Housing Capital Reserve and\n$265 million in debt, all of which will need to be replaced at some point in the future with\na sustainable funding source for capital asset renewal works.\n\nIn 2016, Council adopted a set of Capital Financing Principles (outlined in report CORFSD-16-15, dated June 14, 2016) whereby asset renewal projects should be financed\nthrough reserves and current year revenues from property tax and user rate sources,\nand not through borrowing. At that same time, Regional Council approved the\nimplementation of the Capital Asset Renewal Funding strategy in order to address a\nneed to debt finance capital asset renewal work due to the lack of sufficient pay-as-yougo funding included in budgets. The approved Capital Asset Renewal Funding Strategy\nstrives to achieve 100% pay-as-you-go funding for renewal works across all divisions by\nboth repurposing budget capacity as a result of debt servicing cost savings due to\nrenewal debt retirements as contributions to capital reserves as well as increasing the\ncontribution to capital reserves.\n\nAs reported in staff report COR-FSD-20-19 Reserve and Reserve Fund Adequacy\nUpdate dated July 15, 2020 the Region’s current funding shortfall for funding renewal\nworks contemplated in the 2020-2029 capital program is approximately $45.6 million.\n\nIt is important to note the infrastructure gap would be in addition to the funding shortfall\nbeing addressed through the capital asset renewal funding strategy in order to\ndetermine the total funding gap. Given current estimates, the Region’s total annual\nfunding gap would be in the range of approximately $74.2 million if the asset\nmanagement plan were fully implemented.\n\nIn the absence of sufficient levels of pay-as-you-go funding, the Region will continue to\nrequire to debt finance asset renewal work which, as a financing strategy, is more costly\nin the long term due to additional interest costs that must be incurred. In addition, debt\nfinancing of asset renewal work consumes regional debt capacity which should be\npreserved for significant asset expansions and additions. As outlined in staff report\nCOR-FSD-20-18 Long Term Financial Sustainability Update dated July 15, 2020, the\nupdate to the Capital Asset Renewal Funding Strategy, as currently contemplated, will\ntake approximately six years to fully implement and only takes into account the funding\nshortfall associated with the 10 year capital program. The capital asset renewal funding\nstrategy would avoid debt issuances totalling $130 million, reduce debt outstanding for\nRegional asset renewal works by $92 million by 2029, and avoid associated interest\ncosts totalling $22.3 million, assuming the debt would have been issued for a 10 year\nterm at an average cost of borrowing of 3.0%.\n\nOperating Revenues\n\nThe four main sources of funding for the Region’s operating budget include:\n\n  - user rates\n\n  - property taxes\n\n  - user fees\n\n  - subsidies\n\n**Region of Waterloo** | AM Plan | Doc No. 3329097 | 37\n\n', 'the Association of Municipalities of Ontario (AMO) on behalf of the Federal Government as per the agreement\nfor the transfer of revenues. For 2024 the City of Waterloo will receive $3.8 million from CCBF under the\nannual program. Annual, stable, and predictable allocation grant programs like the CCBF are optimal for\nmunicipal planning and capital budgeting as it allows the City to allocate the CCBF funds to assets that require\nrehab/replacement, similar to how we allocate CIRRF funding during capital budget development to the assets\nwith the highest need as per the Waterloo DSS.\n##### 4�.2�.5 User fees / rate model\n\nThe City has operated several divisions/sections under a ‘User Fee/Rate Model’ for many years. The model\noperates under the principles of a full cost recovery operation. If the user fees were set at full cost recovery,\nthere would be no tax base impact, however, this is not always possible due to other factors including price\nelasticity.\n\n***Tax Base Operations***\n\nFor tax base operations, user fees are applied based on the principle of full cost recovery, to the extent possible,\nfor services residents choose to participate in. Examples include user fees for community space rentals in\nfacilities, and sport field rental fees. While the user fees are based on full cost recovery principles, the fees are\nmonitored and compared against the market and neighbouring municipalities. Other factors include market\nconditions, and community benefit/need, and as such fees cannot always be set at full cost recovery and may\nrequire some level of tax base support.\n\n***Rate Base Operations***\n\nThe rate-based budget philosophy results in the development of realistic and adequate resource alignment to\nmeet the Council approved level of service within a specific division; and an associated user fee is generally\napplied as the revenue source. Once adopted, within the parameters of Council policy guidelines, these divisions\noperate with anticipated revenues and expenditures and balance minor annual fluctuations using a reserve/\nreserve fund. Of significant value to this concept is the ability for the division to plan on a 10-year cycle; while\nat the same time allowing latitude for addressing unexpected changes to operations or Council direction.\n\nSuccessful divisional/section examples of the “Rate Model” in the City currently include the City Utilities division\n(water, sanitary and stormwater), Parking (section within the Economic Development division), and Cemeteries\n(section within the Parks, Forestry and Cemetery Services division).\n##### 4�.2�.6 Rationalization of Existing City Assets\n\nThe City owns a variety of assets that will reach the end of their useful life or are no longer needed by the\norganization. Most assets will be rehabilitated or replaced upon reaching the end of their useful life, however,\nin some instances, the assets (e.g. land) may be deemed surplus and sold with the net proceeds then being\npotentially available to use for the treatment of other City assets.\n##### 4�.3 Infrastructure Funding\n\nThe capital budget contains the most significant portion of funding allocated for both tax base and rate funded\ninfrastructure systems, with the balance provided through the operating budget.

What is the Waterloo Decision Support System (DSS)?,"A custom-built system used to forecast performance of assets over 25 years based on inventory, performance, deterioration trends, and budget data.","['## 1 Introduction\n\nThe City of Waterloo (City) is a lower-tier, mid-sized city in southwestern Ontario, with a population of just\nover 151,000, including about 31,000 students. Home to three leading post-secondary institutions, it attracts\nsome of the best and brightest talent from Canada and around the world. Located in the heart of Canada’s\nTechnology Triangle, the City is one of the fastest-growing regions in Canada in terms of both population\nand employment. Many people have chosen Waterloo as a place to live, work, play and learn as it offers a\nharmonious balance of open space, amenities, employment opportunities and a vibrant uptown. Residents\nexpect innovation when managing operations and almost $4 billion in assets with the City’s limited financial\n\nresources.\n\nTo assist the current and growing community, the City is responsible for providing a significant number of\nservices such as recreational facilities (indoor and outdoor), roads, the active transportation network (sidewalks,\ntrails, and trail links), cemetery services, day camps, senior services, stormwater management, water distribution,\nand sanitary collection.\n\nThe City has supported growth throughout the past few decades by building the infrastructure needed to offer\nservices to the community. The need to maintain assets such as water pipes, sanitary pumping stations, roads,\nfacilities, parks, and trees is not new, but prioritizing which assets are replaced and when is a challenge. The\nCity has been actively practicing a form of asset management for several decades. Computerized maintenance\nmanagement systems assisted in the development of maintenance quality standards for infrastructure\ncomponents, such as the method and frequency of inspections.\n\nTo further assist the City’s asset management (AM) activities, an ambitious program completed in 2016\nestablished an integrated approach to activating corporate asset management throughout the organization.\nThe program engaged 50+ staff from across the City who are directly involved, or support infrastructure-related\ndecision-making for the various asset classes and Council. A key element was the development of the\nCity’s custom-built decision support analytical system. The system, the Waterloo Decision Support System\n(Waterloo DSS) demonstrates the relationship between planned activities and asset performance for all the\nasset classes identified in **Table 1** . The data for the assets is managed by subject matter experts (SME) within\nthe City.\n\n\n19\n\n', 'This three-pronged approach ensures that the performance of the City’s assets supports the community’s\nsocioeconomic growth over the short and long term. The Waterloo DSS provides information to staff for their\nreview and consideration when recommending assets for replacement or rehabilitation of underperforming\ninfrastructure and the related consequences are minimized. In addition to their inherent expertise, SMEs always\nconsider a wide range of factors during infrastructure decision-making processes to minimize risk, as included in\n\nsection 5.3.\n\nPlease refer to the corresponding sections in Appendix B: Tax Base Funded, Appendix C: Enterprise Funded\nAssets and Appendix D: Uptown BIA for asset class specific information.\n\n\n81\n\n', 'Strategic steps will include:\n\n- Continuous improvement of the Waterloo DSS analysis capabilities\n\n- Continuous improvement of forecasting logic\n\n- Corporate awareness and training\n\nTactical steps will include:\n\n- Minimizing impact on staff time concerning sharing information required for the Waterloo DSS\n\n- Partnering with SMEs to better understand their practices to provide data that can be used in day-to-day\n\ndecision-making\n\n- Reviewing Level of Service metrics to better understand the implications and incorporate more metrics\n\nas appropriate.\n\n- Recommending the inclusion of an operating funding increase of $10,000 as part of the 2027 budget process\n\nfor Council’s consideration\n\nOperational steps will include:\n\n- Where applicable, developing data and condition collection processes\n\n- Continuous engagement with SMEs on progress\n\n\n209\n\n', 'The Waterloo DSS analysis uses the most recently approved capital budget and forecast, the 2023 Approved\nCapital Budget and 2024-2032 Capital Forecast. In addition, unspent Council-approved rehabilitation, and\nreplacement funding from prior budget cycles for projects currently underway has also been included. The\nWaterloo DSS then uses the City’s 10-year average capital funding for the remaining 11-25 years.\n\nDeveloping and sustaining public infrastructure is a complex and challenging task requiring continuous\nimprovement and monitoring. Since the development and approval of the City’s first comprehensive asset\nmanagement plan in 2016, staff throughout the organization have been improving the data maturity (quantity,\nquality, and completeness). In addition, AM staff have been working with SMEs to improve the forecasting\ncapabilities of the Waterloo DSS.\n\nThe term “Levels of Service” (LOS) migrated to public infrastructure management from sectors incurring\nexpenditures related to person-to-person services, rather than consumer goods. Most of the expenditure\nrelated to public infrastructure management is concentrated on providing the end user (i.e. public) with a service\ndelivered via infrastructure (e.g. safe drinking water via a watermain). As such, the LOS provided by public\ninfrastructure is directly proportional to the performance of that infrastructure. The budget scenario and target\nscenario performance graphs in each section quantify and illustrate the LOS provided by an asset class to the\npublic. From an SME, engineering, and academic point of view, this is the primary and objective\nLOS quantification for public infrastructure.\n\nPlease refer to the corresponding sections in Appendix B: Tax Base Funded, Appendix C: Enterprise Funded\nAssets and Appendix D: Uptown BIA for asset class specific information.\n##### 5�.4�.1 \x07Current Performance and Projected Impact of Budgeted Capital Expenditures\n\nThe degree to which an asset can fulfill its intended purpose is the performance level at which it performs.\nWhen discussing asset performance, it is important to note that the term “asset class” or “asset group” is\ntypically used interchangeably with “asset.” At the most granular level of an asset class inventory are the\nindividual assets making up that class. Individual assets cannot fulfill their intended purpose unless they are\nconnected to other individual assets in the physical environment. For example, a road section which is not\nconnected to the rest of the road network (i.e. the roads asset class) has no value to the community and is\ntherefore not an asset. Similarly, a pipe which is not connected to the rest of the sanitary collection network\n(i.e. the sanitary asset class) has no value to the community and is therefore not an asset, and so on. It is\ntherefore only when the individual assets are arranged together to create a network that they realize their full\npotential of being an asset to the community. This realization manifests itself in the form of an asset class, and\nthen typically the “class” part is dropped for communication convenience.\n\nSubsequently, when looking at asset performance, it is important to forecast at the asset class level, as it is\nat this level that the community is served. Even when an administration is not projected to spend funds on\nindividual assets for decades, by being a part of their respective asset classes, their performance is still serving\nthe community.\n\nThe same logic applies to naturally “disconnected” individual assets. For example, a City of 100,000+ residents\ncannot be served adequately with one park or one recreational facility; a group of facilities making up an asset\nclass is necessary.\n\n\n73\n\n', '**Single Source of Truth (SSOT)**\n\nA data architecture practice that consolidates information from various subsystems within an organization into a\nsingular, centralized location.

What is the city's current target for overall road PQI?,60 PQI.,"['segment is based on the classification of larger volume arterial roads (like Union Street and Albert Street), and\ncollector roads (such as William Street and Beechwood Drive) have a higher target condition than lower volume\nlocal and residential roads. The City has an overall road network target of 60 PQI; currently, the assessed PQI\n\nlevel is 59.\n\nTo maximize spending effectiveness, roads are primarily replaced in coordination with other underground\ninfrastructure work, such as watermains or sanitary/storm sewer repairs or replacements. Roads are typically\nrehabilitated rather than replaced when only the road requires attention. The timing of proposed developments\nis also considered when deciding whether to replace or rehabilitate a road.\n\nFurther, road renewal is guided by performance “windows” for which different renewal strategies can be applied.\nIf the performance of a road falls below a certain PQI, then rehabilitation is no longer practical, and the road will\nrequire a full replacement. **Table 17** summarizes the target performance for each road classification in the City.\n\n**TABLE 17: ROAD CLASSIFICATION PERFORMANCE TARGETS**\n\n|ROAD CLASSIFICATION|PERFORMANCE TARGET|\n|---|---|\n|Arterial and Collector|Forecast rehabilitation or replacement when PQI falls below 55 Forecast replacement when PQI falls below 45 Minimum PQI target is 20|\n|Local and Rural|Forecast rehabilitation or replacement when PQI falls below 50 Forecast replacement when PQI falls below 40 Minimum PQI target is 20|\n|Alley|Forecast rehabilitation or replacement when PQI falls below 40 Forecast replacement when PQI falls below 35 Minimum PQI target is 20|\n\n\n\nFor sidewalks and trails, we repair them on complaint response basis and replace them once they reach a very\npoor performance. **Table 18** lists examples of maintenance, rehabilitation, and replacement practices the City\nundertakes for the transportation assets.\n\n\n98\n\n', '|SERVICE ATTRIBUTE|QUANTITATIVE METRICS|2021|2022|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Quality|Description or images that illustrate the difef rent levels of road class pavement condition.|58|59|\n||Description or images that illustrate the difef rent levels of asphalt walkway condition.|Good|Good|\n\n\n|TABLE 21: IMAGES OF ROAD PAVEMENT QUALITY INDEX|Col2|Col3|\n|---|---|---|\n|PAVEMENT CONDITION DESCRIPTION EXAMPLE Excellent • Ofef rs a smooth ride • Is aesthetically pleasing • Has no cracks/minor cracks • Has good drainage • Has no patching • Condition score of 81-100|||\n|Good|• Ofef rs a smooth ride • Is aesthetically pleasing • Has minor cracks • Has good drainage • Has no patching • Condition score of 61-80||\n|Fair|• Ofef rs a decent ride • Has some cracks • Has patches • Repairs made but smooth • Has started to deteriorate • Resurfacing candidate • Condition score of 41-60||\n|Poor|• Provides a bumpy ride • Has several patches • Has sunken manhole covers • Many cracks • Requires reconstruction • Condition score of 21-40||\n\n\n108\n\n', 'Technical Levels of Service\n\nThe following table outlines the quantitative metrics that determine the technical\nlevel of service provided by the road network.\n\n\n\n\nScope\n\nQuality\n\n\nLane-km of arterial roads (MMS classes 1 and 2)\n0.027\nper land area (km/km [2] )\n\nLane-km of collector roads (MMS classes 3 and 4)\n0.019\nper land area (km/km [2] )\n\nLane-km of local roads (MMS classes 5 and 6)\n1.43\nper land area (km/km [2] )\n\nAverage pavement condition index for paved\n11%\nroads in the munici p alit y\n\nAverage surface condition for unpaved roads in\nVery Poor\nthe municipality (e.g. excellent, good, fair, poor)\n\n\nPerformance Capital reinvestment rate 1.4%\n\n35\n\n', 'City of Guelph Corporate Asset Management Plan 2024 Transportation Services\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n|Strategic Theme|LOS Type|Performance Measure|Current Performance|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Foundations|Customer|Description or images that illustrate the different levels of road class pavement condition.|The City of Guelph adheres to and follows the standards and best practices described in the Ontario Good Roads Association (OGRA) when defining pavement condition.

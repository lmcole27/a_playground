This involves managing a reliable water system capable of providing\nsufficient quality, flow, and pressure to satisfy drinking, recreational, irrigation, fire protection, and business\nneeds. Treated drinking water is purchased from the Region of Waterloo and distributed to the community by\nthe City of Waterloo. The Region of Waterloo manages all water treatment plants and sells the treated water\nto the lower-tier municipalities within the Region, like the City.\n\nWater distribution is a highly regulated service, and the City of Waterloo must meet strict provincial\nregulations and drinking water quality standards. This requires an extensive network of infrastructure valued at\napproximately $635 million. It is important to note that the fleet and associated equipment (e.g. flusher truck)\nare captured under the fleet asset class.\n\nPlease see section 5.1 for an overview of the context and asset management regarding ownership and\nreplacement value.

Through the 2023 Approved Capital Budget and 2024-2032 Capital Forecast, it is\nestimated that the City will invest $86 million in funding over the next ten years in water distribution assets, of\nwhich $67 million is for rehabilitation activities.

Financial constraints have resulted in the City of Waterloo identifying\ninfrastructure projects that cannot be implemented during the 2024-2032 period. As noted earlier, the\nestimated annual infrastructure funding gap is approximately $54.4 million ($37.6 million for tax-funded assets\nand $16.8 million for enterprise-funded assets). Additional funding is required to achieve a level of service\nanticipated to be acceptable to most interested and affected parties. The City’s average annual funding target is\nbased on maintaining the average performance of assets with a fair or better performance profile. This reflects\nthe fact that the City’s infrastructure assets are in various performance categories and will need rehabilitation\nor replacement at different times. The required expenditures have been established based on an analysis of the\navailable asset data, combined with professional management strategies, to determine why, when, and how each\ndifferent type of asset should be renewed. Since it is not financially sustainable to maintain all assets with an\nexcellent performance profile, that approach has not been incorporated in the City’s approach to AM.\n\nAdditional infrastructure expenditure is required to achieve a level of service that is anticipated to be acceptable\nto most interested parties. The required expenditures have been established based on an analysis of the most\ngranular asset data available in the City combined with operational level decision-making strategies about when\nand how each different type of asset is renewed. **Table 12** identifies the additional annual contributions needed\nto fund the target scenario for each asset class and was used to inform the City’s 2023 LTFP. While the plan to\nbegin the process of closing the infrastructure funding gap has been approved, the average annual infrastructurefunding gap is influenced by escalating construction costs, continued deterioration, rehabilitation or replacement\nimprovements, improved asset inventory data, and the addition of assets that were previously excluded. As each\nof these inputs is enhanced, the average annual infrastructure-funding gap is refined. Since 2020, Council has\nreceived an annual update on the status of the City’s average annual infrastructure gap as shown in **Table 12**\nIt is estimated that this process will continue and that, during that time, the estimated annual infrastructure gap\nwill be progressively amended to reflect new and/or improved information.Figure 12 breaks down the information in fugure 11 by asset class: transportation, facilities, parks, forestry, fire, I T, bibrary, bridges, water distributionm sanitary collection, stormwater, parking, fleet and cemeteries.\n\n\n62\n\n', '***8.3.3.1 What do we own and what is it worth?***\n\nThe 2023 replacement value of the City’s sanitary collection network is estimated at $526 million and includes\n421 km of sanitary pipe and six sewage pumping stations. The City’s sanitary collection assets are the sewers\nand pumping stations that carry wastewater away from our homes and businesses.

The goal of asset\nmanagement is to minimize the lifecycle costs of delivering infrastructure services,\nmanage the associated risks, while maximizing the value ratepayers receive from\nthe asset portfolio.\n\nThe acquisition of capital assets accounts for only 10-20% of their total cost of\nownership. The remaining 80-90% derives from operations and maintenance. This\nAMP focuses its analysis on the capital costs to maintain, rehabilitate and replace\nexisting municipal infrastructure assets.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese costs can span decades, requiring planning and foresight to ensure financial\nresponsibility is spread equitably across generations. An asset management plan is\ncritical to this planning and is an essential element of a broader asset management\nprogram. The industry-standard approach and sequence to developing a practical\nasset management program begins with a Strategic Plan, followed by an Asset\nManagement Policy and an Asset Management Strategy, concluding with an Asset\nManagement Plan.\n\nThis industry standard, defined by the Institute of Asset Management (IAM),\nemphasizes the alignment between the corporate strategic plan and various asset\nmanagement documents. The strategic plan has a direct, and cascading impact on\nasset management planning and reporting.\n###### **Foundational Documents **\n\nIn the municipal sector, ‘asset management strategy’ and ‘asset management plan’\nare often used interchangeably. Other concepts such as ‘asset management\nframework’, ‘asset management system’, and ‘strategic asset management plan’\nfurther add to the confusion; lack of consistency in the industry on the purpose and\ndefinition of these elements offers little clarity. To make a clear distinction between\nthe policy, strategy, and the plan see the following sections for detailed descriptions\nof the document types.\n\n**Strategic Plan**\n\nThe strategic plan has a direct, and cascading impact on asset management\nplanning and reporting, making it a foundational element.

Until that time,\ndespite years where the forecast funding is predicted\nto be greater than the forecast needs, the cumulative\neffect of previous years insufficient funding means that\nthe sustainability target will not be reached.\n\nFigure 19 presents the ratio of funding to needs and\npresents the actual renewal cost forecast and funding\nvalues. Note that to be able to represent the year\nwhen sustainability is reached these two figures both\nuse a 30-year forecast instead of the 25-year period in\nprevious charts.\n\nWith the current funding strategies being used the\nservices will be underfunded through the next 25years accumulating a negative funding gap that\nreaches a nadir around year 2039.

Here are the key insights regarding this decline:

1. **Current Asset Condition**: Only 39% of tax-funded assets are in fair or better condition. This implies a significant portion of the assets could deteriorate further if not adequately funded.

2. **Funding Gap**: The cumulative effect of insufficient funding over the years means that the services will be underfunded for the next 25 years. This underfunding accumulates a negative gap that peaks around 2039, leading to a potential decline in service levels.

3. **Annual Capital Requirements**: The average annual capital requirement to sustain the current level of service is approximately $15.5 million. However, forecasted funding does not meet this requirement consistently, leading to a growing backlog and an overall decline in asset performance.

4. **Investment Needs vs. Forecast Funding**: To maintain current service levels, a total investment of approximately $459.8 million over 25 years is needed, which equates to about $18.4 million per year. However, to eliminate the backlog and improve service levels, the investment would need to be approximately $651.5 million, or $26.1 million annually.

5. **Future Projections**: The sustainability target for these tax-funded services is not predicted to be reached until around 2056. Only after 2048 are funding levels forecasted to exceed service needs, marking the beginning of a potential recovery in asset performance.

What is the primary funding source mentioned for infrastructure renewal?,Capital Infrastructure Reinvestment Reserve Fund (CIRRF).,"['infrastructure that is not eligible for development charges funding but is required to support growth\nand meet community expectations for improved service levels.\n\nThe last several years have seen an increase in the use of incremental tax levies by municipalities in\norder to build up the fiscal capacity to fund asset management needs. While they come under\ndifferent names – special capital levy, capital infrastructure levy, infrastructure renewal levy – the\nconcept is generally the same: included in the annual operating budget is an incremental provision\n(either a dollar amount or a percentage of the tax levy) that is transferred to a Capital\nAsset/Infrastructure Renewal Reserve, which then serves as a source of funding for future asset\nmanagement capital works.\n\nThe ultimate goal is to achieve a level of annual funding to the reserve that will adequately fund the\nmunicipality’s asset renewal capital needs over a longer term. An incremental increase in the form of\nan infrastructure levy can provide a reliable and sustainable source of funding, enabling the City to\nprioritize and address infrastructure needs over time without overburdening tax and rate payers or\nrelying heavily on uncertain grants and external sources. Incremental tax and rate increases can help\nclose the infrastructure gap by gradually providing additional revenue to fund the long-term\nmaintenance, renewal, and improvement of the City’s infrastructure.\n\nAs part of the 2024 Budget process, City staff prepared a business case entitled “Sustainable\nInfrastructure Renewal Funding”. Staff proposed several options to address the need for additional\nfunding for asset renewal works, and City Council ultimately adopted resolutions that provided for:\n\n  - The establishment of an Infrastructure Renewal Reserve Fund;\n\n  - Increased inflationary adjustments to the Capital Levy Reserve;\n\n  - A re-purposing of 80 percent of the Capital Levy Reserve to be an initial contribution to the\nnew Infrastructure Renewal Reserve Fund; and\n\n  - An incremental 1 percent contribution annually to the Infrastructure Renewal Reserve Fund\ncommencing in 2024 and continuing until a fully sustainable infrastructure plan is achieved.\n\nAs calculated in 2024, a 1 percent tax levy amounts to the equivalent of about $17 per household\nand currently raises approximately $1.2 million.

Home to three leading post-secondary institutions, it attracts\nsome of the best and brightest talent from Canada and around the world. Located in the heart of Canada’s\nTechnology Triangle, the City is one of the fastest-growing regions in Canada in terms of both population\nand employment. Many people have chosen Waterloo as a place to live, work, play and learn as it offers a\nharmonious balance of open space, amenities, employment opportunities and a vibrant uptown. Residents\nexpect innovation when managing operations and almost $4 billion in assets with the City’s limited financial\n\nresources.\n\nTo assist the current and growing community, the City is responsible for providing a significant number of\nservices such as recreational facilities (indoor and outdoor), roads, the active transportation network (sidewalks,\ntrails, and trail links), cemetery services, day camps, senior services, stormwater management, water distribution,\nand sanitary collection.\n\nThe City has supported growth throughout the past few decades by building the infrastructure needed to offer\nservices to the community. The need to maintain assets such as water pipes, sanitary pumping stations, roads,\nfacilities, parks, and trees is not new, but prioritizing which assets are replaced and when is a challenge. The\nCity has been actively practicing a form of asset management for several decades. Computerized maintenance\nmanagement systems assisted in the development of maintenance quality standards for infrastructure\ncomponents, such as the method and frequency of inspections.\n\nTo further assist the City’s asset management (AM) activities, an ambitious program completed in 2016\nestablished an integrated approach to activating corporate asset management throughout the organization.\nThe program engaged 50+ staff from across the City who are directly involved, or support infrastructure-related\ndecision-making for the various asset classes and Council. A key element was the development of the\nCity’s custom-built decision support analytical system. The system, the Waterloo Decision Support System\n(Waterloo DSS) demonstrates the relationship between planned activities and asset performance for all the\nasset classes identified in **Table 1** . The data for the assets is managed by subject matter experts (SME) within\nthe City.\n\n\n19\n\n', '**TABLE 6: QUALITATIVE DESCRIPTION OF PERFORMANCE INDICATORS**\n\n|ASSET PERFORMANCE SCORE|RATING|QUALITATIVE DESCRIPTION|\n|---|---|---|\n|80-100%|Excellent|Fit for the future.

If a recent condition assessment is not available, there are various ways performance is calculated,\nsuch as comparing age to its expected service life. In other cases, the calculation may be tied to known defects\n(e.g. cracks or heaves in sidewalks) or may be calculated using a variety of factors (e.g. watermains – the\nnumber of breaks/size of pipe/location of pipe/age). When forecasting performance over 25 years, a straight-line\ndeterioration curve based on estimated service life is used to deteriorate the performance of the asset. Some\nasset classes follow a unique condition curve based on professional expertise from SMEs and AM. Examples\ninclude Forestry and IT software.\n### 3�.5 \x07Levels of Service – Expenditure Needs and Asset Performance\n\nUsing the Waterloo DSS, staff can develop scenarios to project future performance and the primary scenarios\ndeveloped are budget and target scenarios. To assist in the budget and target scenario projections, staff\nthroughout the organization work collaboratively to improve data and processes. The individual analysis at the\noperational and tactical levels can then be consolidated to obtain a strategic perspective on the overall suite of\nassets.

It serves as a foundation for the city's asset management practices, helping to address the complexities of maintaining and renewing a wide array of municipal assets, such as roads, sidewalks, and facilities, while optimizing financial resources.

Key features of the Waterloo DSS include:

1. **Asset Performance Evaluation**: The system assesses the performance of various assets based on multiple criteria, allowing city staff to identify which assets require attention or prioritization for renewal and maintenance.

2. **Scenario Development**: Users can simulate different budget scenarios and target scenarios to project future asset performance based on historical data and planned funding allocations. This allows the city to analyze the effects of various funding levels on asset condition and performance.

3. **Integration with Financial Planning**: The DSS incorporates data from the city's capital budgets and uses forecasting logic to determine the necessary expenditures needed to meet established service levels, thus facilitating informed budgeting and financial planning.

4. **Collaboration with Subject Matter Experts (SMEs)**: The system relies on input from SMEs within the city to ensure accurate assessment and relevant data management for each asset class.

5. **Continuous Improvement**: The Waterloo DSS is designed to evolve, with ongoing enhancements to its analysis capabilities and forecasting logic, allowing for more effective decision-making as new data and methodologies become available.

Overall, the Waterloo DSS represents a strategic approach to asset management, enabling the City of Waterloo to better meet community needs while effectively managing its limited financial resources and ensuring the longevity and performance of its infrastructure.",0.39399203658103943

Roads are typically\nrehabilitated rather than replaced when only the road requires attention. The timing of proposed developments\nis also considered when deciding whether to replace or rehabilitate a road.\n\nFurther, road renewal is guided by performance “windows” for which different renewal strategies can be applied.\nIf the performance of a road falls below a certain PQI, then rehabilitation is no longer practical, and the road will\nrequire a full replacement. **Table 17** summarizes the target performance for each road classification in the City.\n\n**TABLE 17: ROAD CLASSIFICATION PERFORMANCE TARGETS**\n\n|ROAD CLASSIFICATION|PERFORMANCE TARGET|\n|---|---|\n|Arterial and Collector|Forecast rehabilitation or replacement when PQI falls below 55 Forecast replacement when PQI falls below 45 Minimum PQI target is 20|\n|Local and Rural|Forecast rehabilitation or replacement when PQI falls below 50 Forecast replacement when PQI falls below 40 Minimum PQI target is 20|\n|Alley|Forecast rehabilitation or replacement when PQI falls below 40 Forecast replacement when PQI falls below 35 Minimum PQI target is 20|\n\n\n\nFor sidewalks and trails, we repair them on complaint response basis and replace them once they reach a very\npoor performance. **Table 18** lists examples of maintenance, rehabilitation, and replacement practices the City\nundertakes for the transportation assets.\n\n\n98\n\n', '2024 Interim Asset Management Plan\n\n**Levels of Service**\n\n**Current Levels of Service**\n\nUnder O.Reg.588/17, for our core assets, we are required to report the technical metrics for our current LoS.

The value of the forecast\nrenewal needs for the roads in the worst three\ncondition ratings is approximately $453M. In total\navout 70% of the roads have a PCI score less of “fair”\n\nor worse. The values of roads in each PCI condition\ncategory are presented in Table 16, this provides a\nmore detailed summary of the condition and value of\nthe roads by road class.\n\nPerhaps more important than the physical condition,\nroads are often used as an informal metric by the\nmedia and general public as an indicator of the\ncondition of the City as a whole. Because the road\nnetwork is integral to the City and the asset or service\ntype that the most people would make use of on a\nday-to-day basis the condition of the roads can be a\nliability to the perception of the City: many complaints\nand questions are presented to City Hall asking about\nthe condition of the roads.\n\ncompleted in April-May 2024 but the results will not be\navailable in time to include in this AMP.\n\nPage 71\n\n', 'City of Guelph Corporate Asset Management Plan 2024 Transportation Services\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n|Strategic Theme|LOS Type|Performance Measure|Current Performance|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Foundations|Customer|Description or images that illustrate the different levels of road class pavement condition.|The City of Guelph adheres to and follows the standards and best practices described in the Ontario Good Roads Association (OGRA) when defining pavement condition.

In addition to the\noperating funding, the City needs to continue to invest the $7 million annually and increase capital funding to\nclose the $23 million average funding gap as identified in **Table 12** . The total funding required to provide the\nlifecycle activities to maintain the current level is $31.6 million each year.\n\nThe forecasted funding requirements to accommodate growth to maintain services are identified in **Table 11**\nand will be evaluated, refined, and approved by Council through each budget process.\n\n***8.2.1.4.1 Current Performance and Projected Impact of Budgeted Capital Expenditures***\n\nAbout 31% of the transportation assets are currently considered in poor or very poor performance, as\nillustrated in **Figure 15** . Over the 25-year timeline, with the current level of funding, we anticipate the\npercentage of our transportation assets with a poor or very poor performance profile to increase to\napproximately 83% which is anticipated to be unacceptable to most interested and affected parties. Based on the\nbest available asset data, deterioration rates and 2023-2032 capital funding, we estimate that transportation assets\nhave an annual infrastructure funding gap of $23 million. The infrastructure funding gap is primarily attributed to\nthe road network at $16 million and the remaining transportation assets having a gap of $7 million.\n\n**FIGURE 15: PROJECTED ANNUAL PERFORMANCE OF TRANSPORTATION NETWORK ASSETS**\n**IN THE BUDGET SCENARIOEstimated infrastructure funding gap for transportation assets is $23 million, mainly attributed to the road network.**\n\n\n101\n\n', '### **Portfolio Overview **\n\nThe ten service areas analyzed in this asset management plan have a total current replacement\ncost of approximately $534 million.

What is the estimated total value of the City of Waterloo's infrastructure?,Approximately $4 billion.,"['# Appendix B – Transportation Services \n\n**B.1** **State of Local Infrastructure**\n\nThe overall transportation system is valued at **$2.01 billion**, and is rated in overall **good**\ncondition, with **90.1%** of assets in fair or better condition. This reflects the relatively low\nage of the Region’s transportation infrastructure, as well as recent investments in asset\nrenewal.\n### **Total Asset ** **Valuation (2019$)** **$2.01 billion ** **Average Asset ** **Condition (2019)** **GOOD**\n\n**Replacement Value**\n\nRoadway pavement and bridges account for a significant portion of the replacement\nvalue, as summarized in the following figure:\n\n**Region of Waterloo** | AM Plan | Doc No. 3329097 | 59\n\n', '# Appendix K – Corporate & Other Services \n\n**K.1** **State of Local Infrastructure**\n\nThe facilities and fleet assets for Corporate Services is valued at **$419.9 million**, and\nare rated in overall **good** condition, with **94.8%** of assets in fair or better condition.\n\n\n\n**Replacement Value and Condition**\n\n\n**Region of Waterloo** | AM Plan | Doc No. 3329097 | 138\n\n', '***8.3.3.1 What do we own and what is it worth?***\n\nThe 2023 replacement value of the City’s sanitary collection network is estimated at $526 million and includes\n421 km of sanitary pipe and six sewage pumping stations. The City’s sanitary collection assets are the sewers\nand pumping stations that carry wastewater away from our homes and businesses. The City of Waterloo is\nrequired to have sufficient maintenance and rehabilitation funding for this system to meet provincial regulations.\n\nPlease see section 5.1 for an overview of the context and asset management regarding ownership and\nreplacement value.

The operating expenditures related to infrastructure\noperation and maintenance are in the range of **$5 million** annually. The following graph\nforecasts these costs to increase proportionately with growth and upgrade of the asset\nportfolio however this forecast may not be realistic as it is driven by a major building\nreplacement, a significant amount of which is renewal as described above and will not\nresult in such significant operating cost increases.\n\n**Region of Waterloo** | AM Plan | Doc No. 3329097 | 123\n\n', '2024 Interim Asset Management Plan\n#### **APPENDIX B: ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES **\n##### **Total Replacement Value ** **$2,487.8 Million ** **Overall Average Asset Condition ** **Good ** **Asset Quick Facts **\n\n  The city owns 533km of watermains and maintains additional 80km of\n\nwatermains for Region of Waterloo for supplying safe drinking water\n\nto residents\n\n  21 Pumping Stations and 559km of wastewater pipes\n\n  Over 1,200 minor culverts, 397 km of city owned storm pipes and 120\n\nstorm facilities (includes infiltration galleries)\n\nPage | 32\n\n']",0.16944091022014618,0.696790337562561,"Based on the provided information, the estimated total value of the City of Waterloo's infrastructure can be calculated by summing the values of different components:

are not covered in this AM Plan. Only facilities and fleet\nassets are included in this AM Plan for the following Service Areas. Although other\nprogram assets may be included in future plans, the facility and fleet assets comprise\nthe greatest value of assets within these areas:\n\n  Waterloo Region Housing\n\n  - Children’s Services\n\n  - Seniors’ Services\n\n - Paramedic Services\n\n  Waterloo Regional Police.\n\nWater Services manages the following assets which are owned by the Region but not\nincluded in this AM Plan:\n\n  Monitoring wells\n\n  - Test wells.\n#### 1.5 Legislated Requirements for Asset Management Plans\n\nThe challenges of public sector entities to maintain and renew ageing infrastructure\nunder current funding/resource levels and structures is widely recognized. Rapid\ngrowth, public demands for high levels of service, increased exposure to liability and\nrisk, and downloaded responsibilities add to these challenges. While the Region has a\nlong history of implementing advanced asset management practices that incorporate\nasset renewal, enhanced operation and maintenance practices, policies, and programs,\nthere has also been a legislative and regulatory push for the development of formal\nasset management plans which formalize these strategies.\n\nIn January 2018, the Province of Ontario enacted **Ontario Regulation 588/17** ‘Asset\nManagement Planning for Municipal Infrastructure’ under the Infrastructure for Jobs and\nProsperity Act, 2015. The regulation requires municipalities to develop an AM Plan\nbased on current Levels of Service by July 1st, 2021 for core assets (roads, and bridges\nand culverts, stormwater, water, wastewater) and July 1st, 2023 requirements for other\nmunicipal infrastructure assets. The Region’s core assets support delivery of\ntransportation and water services. By July 1st 2024, a more advanced AM Plan\n(Proposed Levels of Service) is required for all assets. Other legislative and regulatory\nrequirements for Asset Management Plans include the following:\n\n\n**Province of Ontario**\n\n**Infrastructure for**\n**Jobs and**\n**Prosperity Act**\n\n\nThe Infrastructure for Jobs & Prosperity Act (IJPA), 2015 was proclaimed on May\n1, 2016. The purpose of this Act is to establish mechanisms to encourage\nprincipled, evidence-based and strategic long-term infrastructure planning that\nsupports job creation and training opportunities, economic growth and protection of\nthe environment, and incorporate design excellence into infrastructure planning.\nThe Act sets out principles which the Province and all broader public sector entities\n(including Municipalities) should consider when making decisions respecting\ninfrastructure. The Act also stipulates that the Province and all broader public\nsector entities prepare infrastructure asset management plans.\n\n**Region of Waterloo** | AM Plan | Docs No. 3329097 | 5\n\n', '# Executive summary\n#### Introduction\n\nThe Region of Waterloo owns and manages physical\nassets such as roads, traffic signals, buses and related\nfacilities, water and wastewater treatment plants and\npumping stations, groundwater wells, water storage\nfacilities, watermains and sewers, an airport,\nadministrative and cultural buildings, community housing,\nand a fleet of vehicles that together total over **seven**\n**billion dollars** in value.\n\nThe Region relies on these assets to deliver services to\nover 617,000 residents (2019), including university\nstudents, in partnership with seven local municipalities.\nProperly managing its assets helps to ensure the Region\ncan deliver services safely and reliably and provide value\nfor money and long term financial sustainability.\n\nThe purpose of this Asset Management Plan is to support\nthe Region’s stewardship of its assets. It summarizes:\n\n### **This Asset ** **Management Plan ** **does not reflect ** **the impacts of ** **Covid-19.  ** **The Region ** **acknowledges ** **that there will be ** **economic ** **impacts, that will ** **have to be fully ** **assessed at a later ** **date.**\n\n\n\n  The assets the Region relies on to support service delivery to the community\n\n  The current levels of service provided by these assets\n\n  The assets that will be needed in the future to continue to deliver services safely\n\nand reliably\n\n  The activities needed to sustain assets throughout their lifecycles at the best\n\npossible cost\n\n  The funds needed for these assets and activities and how they might be raised\n\n  The steps to improve future versions of this Asset Management Plan.\n\nThe Asset Management Plan was created through workshops and input on assets and\ntheir performance, with participation of staff from across the organization.\n\nExpected growth drives the scale of Regional services and, in turn, the assets needed to\nsupport them. The provincial Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe (referred to\nin this document as Growth Plan 2019) sets out population and employment forecasts.\nThe provincial government mandates the Region to plan for them. The Region has\ncompared the provincial growth forecasts to 2016 census data and has forecasted a\nmoderate growth scenario that projects similar growth but approximately 10 years later\nwithin this planning period. Both of these growth forecasts are considered in the master\nplans and studies that feed into this Asset Management Plan.\n\nAsset management involves balancing asset lifecycle cost, performance and risk. The\ngoal is to deliver required performance at the best possible cost over an asset’s life cycle\nwithin an acceptable level of risk. The need to achieve this balance informed the\nupdated corporate Strategic Asset Management Policy, which was approved by\nRegional Council in March 2019 and appears on the Region’s web site.

What is the forecasted decline in performance of tax-base funded assets over 25 years?,Projected increase of assets in poor or very poor condition from 34% to 76%.,"['The annual infrastructure funding gap is calculated through the comparison of the Waterloo DSS budget and\ntarget scenario outputs. The budget scenario provides perspective on the projected performance of assets\nbased on the budgeted expenditures for each asset group. The target scenario generates the infrastructure\nexpenditure needed to achieve the target levels of service as established through collaboration with SMEs. The\nWaterloo DSS analysis uses the capital funding included in the 2023 Approved Capital Budget and 2024-2032\nCapital Forecast, as well as any unspent rehabilitation and replacement funding from in-progress projects\napproved in prior budget cycles for the first ten years.

They are all important when considering the value of infrastructure and the reliance\non the assets to deliver services to the community. The efforts to integrate AM and financial planning include\nutilizing the Waterloo DSS to help determine the optimal allocation of available treatment funding provided\nthrough reserves, the development of a lifecycle costing methodology and the inclusion of asset-specific data\nwithin capital project sheets used for the budget process. All these activities improve the link between financial\nplanning and AM by allowing for data-driven decisions.\n##### 4�.2�.1 Capital Infrastructure Reinvestment Reserve Fund (CIRRF)\n\nInstituting a property tax increase above inflation dedicated to fund infrastructure renewal activities\n(administered through CIRRF) has proven over the years at the City to be one of the best strategies to fund\nthe additional contributions. This approach provides a more direct line of sight from the taxes that residents\npay to the services/infrastructure that it funds.\n\nSince 2020, Council has implemented a plan to begin narrowing the infrastructure-funding gap. This includes\nCouncil’s approval within the 2020-2022 budget of an increase of $2.1 million by 2022, a $0.7 million increase\nwithin the 2023 budget and increase of $1.3 million as part of the 2024-2026 budget for a total increase of\n$4.1 million annually for infrastructure assets. The additional infrastructure funding was added to the CIRRF\nand since its inception in 2008 by Council, the annual contribution to CIRRF has increased significantly and\nis currently $13.4 million per year in infrastructure-related funding. The new funding approved as part of the\n2024-2026 budget process will be incorporated as part of future AM reporting.\n##### 4�.2�.2 Infrastructure Funding Allocation Methodology\n\nThe capital budget contains the most significant portion of funding allocated for both tax base and rate funded\ninfrastructure systems, with the balance provided through the operating budget. As part of the budget process,\nAM uses the Waterloo DSS to determine the percentage of needs by asset class. The Budget Committee uses\nthese percentages to allocate the limited rehabilitation and replacement funding in the most optimal manner\npossible. The percentage is created based on the concept of what each asset area would need if we had\nunlimited funding. For example, in **Figure 8**, the City’s assets need $1 million in funding to meet target which\n\ntranslates into needs of $250,000 for asset class 1, $300,000 for asset class 2 and $450,000 for the third asset\n\nclass which is then converted into a percentage of needs which translates into 25%, 30% and 45% respectfully.\n\n\n53\n\n', 'Wastewater Historical Funding:\n\n  - Each year, the contribution to capital is impacted by the wastewater rate increase for the year,\n\nplus the allocation of any year-end surplus. This is the primary capital funding source, which has\n\nsuccessfully increased over time by following recommendations in prior and current Water and\n\nWastewater Rate Studies.\n\n  - The Township has vehicle and equipment replacement schedules that have funding increases as\n\nrequired annually.\n\n  - In 2021, the meter maintenance (replacement) and grinder pump programs were combined with\n\ngeneral capital.\n\nFigure 5-9\n\nWastewater Supported Capital Funding\n\n\nGrant Funding Assumptions\n\nGiven the discussion above regarding the proactive historical funding increases provided in this area, any\n\navailable infrastructure grants are typically applied for in tax supported asset categories, such as roads\nand stormwater. In situations where specific grants are tied only to water and/or wastewater\n\ninfrastructure, submissions for funding are made by the Township in this area. Canada Community\nBuilding Funding (Gas Tax) and OCIF funding could be used for water and wastewater projects, however\nthe Township’s practice is to allocate this funding to roads related and bridge/culvert projects.\n\nFor the forecasted financing strategy, there are no known water and wastewater specific grants therefore\n\nit has been assumed that grant funding will not assist in this area. In the event that grant funding\n\nbecomes available, adjustments can be made through the budget process and future asset management\n\nplan updates.\n\nDevelopment Charges Funding Assumptions\n\nPlease refer to the comprehensive development charges discussion in the tax supported financing\n\nstrategy above.\n\n\nPage 116\n\n', '### 4�.4 Infrastructure Gap\n\nAs part of the 2020-2022 and 2023 approved budgets, supported by the 2019 Long Term Financial Plan (LTFP),\nCouncil approved additional funding intended to begin the process of closing the infrastructure gap.

The information gathered\nthrough these efforts has been used to inform the City’s custom Waterloo Decision Support System (Waterloo DSS)\nto help prioritize infrastructure projects and calculate the annual infrastructure-funding gap.\n\nIt is important to note that the information included in this plan is based on the best available information in\n2023 for asset inventory, performance, deterioration trends, estimated replacement, and treatment costs. It also\nincorporates the capital funding within the 2023 Approved Capital Budget and 2024-2032 Capital Forecast and\npreviously approved unspent rehabilitation and replacement funding from prior budgets. As each of these inputs\nis enhanced, the average annual infrastructure-funding gap is refined. It is estimated that this process will take\nseveral years and that, during that time, the estimated annual infrastructure gap will be progressively amended\nto reflect new and/or improved information.\n\nAdvanced AM practice is an equal partnership between subject matter experts (SMEs) (operation and\nmaintenance staff), engineering, finance, senior management, and elected officials. The ability of the City’s staff\nto bridge gaps of knowledge between positions is key to the City’s success. The City’s success has resulted in\nmomentum in advancing municipal AM principles and practices. It is recommended the City continue building\non top of existing processes and build on this momentum. This will enhance the City’s decision-making\neffectiveness for selecting the most appropriate infrastructure improvements and their timing.\n\nIt is important to consider asset needs to reduce the risk of infrastructure underperformance that will\nnegatively affect the quality of life for the community. Examples include the impacts of unplanned road closures,\nincreased water main breaks, or unexpected indoor/outdoor recreational facility closures. Where applicable,\npreventative maintenance or minor repairs is a cost-effective approach that can delay more costly rehabilitation\nor replacement requirements.\n\nBased on the 2023 Approved Capital Budget and 2024-2032 Capital Forecast, the City’s infrastructure funding\nis anticipated to result in an estimated 42% increase in tax-funded assets exhibiting poor and very poor\nperformance over the next 25 years and an estimated 25% increase in enterprise-funded assets. It is anticipated\nthat this level of asset performance will be unacceptable to most interested parties. The most efficient and\neffective way to manage the City’s infrastructure is through skillful investments that includes treating assets\nat the right time and for the right cost. **Table 2** provides an overview of the City of Waterloo’s infrastructure\nand displays the average annual funding gap.

The budget scenario projects future asset performance, based on current\nasset performance, deterioration rates, and Council-approved funding. The target scenario generates the\ninfrastructure expenditure needed to achieve the target levels of service established through collaboration with\nSMEs. Both scenarios use a similar approach for the first year of the projection by using the weighted average\nof replacement cost based on the current asset inventory, performance, replacement costs, and the approved\ninfrastructure funding. The remaining years are a projection based on the deterioration of the assets along with\nthe rehabilitation or replacement of assets based on the approved/forecasted infrastructure funding approved by\n\nCouncil.\n\nThe Waterloo DSS analysis uses the most recently approved capital budget and forecast, the 2023 Approved\nCapital Budget and 2024-2032 Capital Forecast. In addition, unspent Council-approved rehabilitation, and\nreplacement funding from prior budget cycles, for projects currently underway, has also been included. The\nWaterloo DSS then uses the City’s 10-year average capital funding for the remaining years 11-25.\n\nDeveloping and sustaining public infrastructure is a complex and challenging task requiring continuous\nimprovement and monitoring. Since the development and approval of the City’s first comprehensive asset\nmanagement plan in 2016, staff throughout the organization have been improving the data maturity (quantity,\nquality, and completeness). In addition, AM staff have been working with SMEs to improve the forecasting\ncapabilities of the Waterloo DSS. This has resulted in an update to the annual infrastructure funding gap for\n2023 which is estimated to be $54.4 million ($37.6 million is for tax-funded assets and $16.8 million is for\nenterprise-funded assets).\n\nSince 2020, Council has had a plan to narrow the infrastructure funding gap. While the plan has been approved,\nthe infrastructure gap may increase due to increasing construction costs, continued deterioration and the asset\ninventories being updated to reflect assets that were excluded (e.g. retaining walls, library assets). **Table 7**\nidentifies the additional annual contributions needed to fund the target scenario for each asset class and will be\nused to inform the updates to the City’s LTFP.\n\n\n44\n\n', '***8.2.4.8 Risk***\n\nThe risk associated with not undertaking the treatment options available for IT assets is a reduced lifespan,\nincreased cyber-security risks and operational impacts to internal and external customers.

The DSS is primarily designed to help prioritize infrastructure projects and assess the annual funding gap necessary for maintaining and improving city assets.

Key features of the Waterloo DSS include:

1. **Data Integration**: The system utilizes data concerning asset inventory, performance, deterioration trends, replacement and treatment costs, and capital funding. This data is used to generate insights for decision-makers about infrastructure needs.

2. **Forecasting and Analysis**: The Waterloo DSS incorporates advanced forecasting logic to project the performance of city assets over time. It generates two scenarios: the budget scenario (based on current funding and asset performance) and the target scenario (which outlines the funding needed to achieve defined performance levels).

3. **Continuous Improvement**: The City emphasizes ongoing enhancements to the DSS capabilities, including strengthening data collection processes, engaging with subject matter experts (SMEs), and training staff for effective use.

4. **Collaboration**: The success of the Waterloo DSS relies on collaboration among various stakeholders—including engineering, finance, operations, and elected officials—to ensure that all perspectives are considered in infrastructure decision-making.

5. **Risk Management**: The DSS also integrates an understanding of risks associated with infrastructure management, helping to minimize operational impacts and improve the resilience of city services.

The timing of proposed developments\nis also considered when deciding whether to replace or rehabilitate a road.\n\nFurther, road renewal is guided by performance “windows” for which different renewal strategies can be applied.\nIf the performance of a road falls below a certain PQI, then rehabilitation is no longer practical, and the road will\nrequire a full replacement. **Table 17** summarizes the target performance for each road classification in the City.\n\n**TABLE 17: ROAD CLASSIFICATION PERFORMANCE TARGETS**\n\n|ROAD CLASSIFICATION|PERFORMANCE TARGET|\n|---|---|\n|Arterial and Collector|Forecast rehabilitation or replacement when PQI falls below 55 Forecast replacement when PQI falls below 45 Minimum PQI target is 20|\n|Local and Rural|Forecast rehabilitation or replacement when PQI falls below 50 Forecast replacement when PQI falls below 40 Minimum PQI target is 20|\n|Alley|Forecast rehabilitation or replacement when PQI falls below 40 Forecast replacement when PQI falls below 35 Minimum PQI target is 20|\n\n\n\nFor sidewalks and trails, we repair them on complaint response basis and replace them once they reach a very\npoor performance. **Table 18** lists examples of maintenance, rehabilitation, and replacement practices the City\nundertakes for the transportation assets.\n\n\n98\n\n', 'Appendix A: 10-Year Capital Requirements\n\nThe following tables identify the capital cost requirements for each of the next 10 years in order to meet projected\ncapital requirements and maintain the current level of service.\n\n**Road Network**\n\nAsset Segment Backlog 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032\n\nRural Roads $ 56.6m $ 2.3m $ 1.7m $ 2.2m $ 5.8m $ 5.8m $ 6.3m $ 6.7m $ 7.0m $ 7.3m $ 7.7m\n\nSidewalks $ 0 $ 210k $ 210k $ 221k $ 351k $ 0 $ 243k $ 255k $ 281k $ 295k $ 310k\n\nStreetlights $ 0 $ 6k $ 6k $ 6k $ 6k $ 26k $ 6k $ 6k $ 6k $ 26k $ 0\n\nTraffic Lights $ 800k $ 0 $ 0 $ 400k $ 600k $ 0 $ 0 $ 200k $ 200k $ 800k $ 0\n\nUrban Roads $14.2m $2.3m $3.5m $3.2m $0 $0 $885k $0 $273k $0 $763k\n\n**$71.7m** **$** **4.8m** **$** **5.4m** **$** **6.0m** **$** **6.8m** **$** **5.8m** **$** **7.4m** **$** **7.2m** **$** **7.8m** **$** **8.4m** **$** **8.8m**\n\n**Bridges & Culverts**\n\nAsset Segment Backlog 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032\n\nBridges $0 $ 682k $ 373k $ 448k $ 554k $ 312k $ 762k $ 966k $ 352k $ 990k $ 580k\n\nCulverts $0 $ 105k $ 414k $ 379k $ 314k $ 599k $ 243k $ 34k $ 648k $ 110k $ 580k\n\n**$0** **$** **787k** **$** **787k** **$** **827k** **$** **868k** **$** **911k** **$** **1.0m** **$** **1.0m** **$** **1.0m** **$** **1.1m** **$** **1.2m**\n\n135\n\n', 'ii.

State of Local Infrastructure and Levels of Service\n###### **2.1 Transportation **\n\n***2.1.1 State of Local Infrastructure***\n\nThe Township owns and manages a variety of assets that support the provision of\n\nTransportation Services and that contribute to the overall level of service provided by\n\nthe Township. Transportation assets comprise roads, structures, sidewalks, and\nstreetlights. The replacement cost of these assets is approximately $221 million.\n\nThe road network comprises roads with two surface types: asphalt and gravel. Asphalt\n\nroads are further broken down by roadside environment – urban and rural. The\nestimated replacement cost of roads is approximately $158 million. Responsibility for\n\nboundary roads is shared with neighbouring municipalities, reducing the total\nreplacement cost that the Township is responsible for to approximately $153 million.\n\nTable 2-1 provides a breakdown of the road network by surface type and roadside\n\nenvironment, showing centreline-kilometres, average age, replacement cost, and the\n\nTownship’s share of the replacement cost it is responsible for.

On average approximately 9% of transportation\nassets as a percentage by replacement cost ($99 million) will need to be rehabilitated or replaced in 25 years or\nless after installation to maintain the service they provide to the community. As new infrastructure or assets are\nadded due to growth, the need for reinvestment increases (the percentage and value of assets that will need to\nbe rehabilitated or replaced within 25 years will increase), subsequently increasing the infrastructure funding gap.\n\nThe City also spends money on infrastructure through its annual operating budget. **Table 10** within section\n4.3 summarizes the planned expenditures in the Approved 2023 operating budget. The 2023 operating budget\nincluded $1.6 million in funding considered to be directly related to treating transportation assets such as\nretaining wall maintenance activities, pothole repairs and sidewalk replacement activities.\n\nFor the 2024 AMP, the Waterloo DSS analysis is utilizing the most recently approved capital budget\nand forecast, the 2023 Approved Capital Budget and 2024-2032 Capital Forecast. In addition, unspent\nCouncil-approved rehabilitation and replacement funding from prior budget cycles has also been included for\nprojects currently underway. The Waterloo DSS then uses the City’s 10-year average capital funding for the\nremaining years 11-25.\n\nBased on that methodology, the City will invest an average annual of $7 million over the next 25 years on\ntransportation assets. Based on the best available transportation asset data, deterioration rates and 2023-2032\ncapital funding, we estimate that transportation assets have an annual infrastructure funding gap of $23 million\nas outlined in **Table 12** in section 4.4. The average annual infrastructure-funding gap is influenced by escalating\ninflation and replacement costs, continued deterioration, replacements, and improved asset inventory data.\nAs each of these inputs is enhanced, the average annual infrastructure-funding gap is refined. It is estimated\nthat this process will take several years and that, during that time, the estimated annual infrastructure gap\nwill be progressively amended to reflect new and/or improved information.\n\n***8.2.1.3 Lifecycle Management Activities***\n\nPlease see section 5.3 for an overview of the general context and appropriate asset management interpretation\nregarding lifecycle management strategies.\n\nO. Reg 588/17 requires municipalities to document a lifecycle management and financial strategy for assets for\na ten-year period. The Waterloo DSS forecasts the transportation asset class performance and corresponding\nexpenditure over a 25-year timeframe. Once the forecast activities are within the one to three-year span,\nSMEs determine what roads, sidewalks, trails, or signs need to be rehabilitated or replaced. Transportation and\nEngineering SMEs review the asset needs and plan for rehabilitation or replacement to provide an optimized\nutilization of the assets. The City’s current performance for transportation assets is outlined in section 8.2.1.4.1\nand the target performance is outlined in section 8.2.1.4.1. When projecting the performance of assets,\ncondition is important. The condition of roads are assessed through a pavement condition inspection process\non a bi-annual basis. Retaining walls located in the municipal right-of-way are inspected on a bi-annual basis while\nsidewalks and trail condition is assessed annually by City staff while the remaining transportation asset condition\nis performance and age-based.\n\nRoads are rehabilitated when their condition falls below the target pavement quality index (PQI) for a portion\nof the road.

The increases to infrastructure funding included within the 2023 LTFP range\nbetween 1%-1.5% annually.\n\nTo understand the magnitude of the additional annual contributions required to fund the target scenario in\nthe City of Waterloo, a 1% increase in the property tax levy generates approximately $920,000 in additional\nrevenue (based on the 2023 final levy). Therefore, the additional contributions to CIRRF necessary to close\nthe annual infrastructure funding gap represent an increase in property taxes of approximately 40% above and\nbeyond other increases for inflation.\n\nIt is important to recognize that while additional revenue into the reserve funds is required, addressing the\ninfrastructure challenges in the City is about more than collecting additional revenue. The continuous updating\nor operationalizing of AM processes are equally, if not more, important to help:\n\n- Prioritize the assets that are renewed;\n\n- Reduce the required expenditures to achieve the performance objectives of the infrastructure systems; and\n\n- Understand where levels of service may be reduced and result in lower infrastructure expenditure needs.\n\n\n65\n\n', '### 4�.4 Infrastructure Gap\n\nAs part of the 2020-2022 and 2023 approved budgets, supported by the 2019 Long Term Financial Plan (LTFP),\nCouncil approved additional funding intended to begin the process of closing the infrastructure gap.
